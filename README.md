# THIS PROJECT IS ABANDONDED.

minitest-rg added support for colored output to ruby's minitest. It was supposed to 
work with minitest on Ruby 1.8.7, and it used to work well.

This was 2 years ago. Apparently it does not work well any longer. As I myself
don't need minitest-rg any more, I hereby abandon this project. Use at your own risk!

If you want to take over ownership of the minitest-rg gem, please drop me a note.

*Note that currently this project does not even build a gem (on my system), thanks to some 
crazy Psych bug which appears every so often on the internet. Psych, you were supposed 
to improve 'yaml'; but you only break in more spectacular ways. Yik!*
